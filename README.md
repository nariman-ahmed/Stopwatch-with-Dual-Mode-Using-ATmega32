# **Stopwatch with Dual Mode (Increment and Countdown) Using ATmega32 and Seven-Segment Display**

## üìã **Project Overview**
This project is a digital stopwatch built with an **ATmega32 microcontroller** that offers two operational modes:  
1. **Increment Mode (Default):** Counts upwards from zero, displaying hours, minutes, and seconds on six seven-segment displays.  
2. **Countdown Mode:** Counts down from a user-defined time, functioning as a countdown timer.  

The system includes multiple push buttons for user interaction and an alarm/buzzer for notifications.  

## üéØ **Objective**
To design and implement a versatile stopwatch that can switch between increment and countdown modes, offering essential features like reset, pause, and resume.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Features**
- **Reset Function:** Resets the time to zero in both modes.  
- **Pause Function:** Pauses the stopwatch, holding the current time.  
- **Resume Function:** Resumes counting from the paused time.  
- **Mode Toggle:** Allows switching between increment and countdown modes.  
- **Alarm/Buzzer:** Activates at the end of the countdown.  
- **LED Indicators:** Show the current mode and status.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Hardware Components**
- **Microcontroller:** ATmega32 with a 16 MHz system clock.  
- **Display:** Six multiplexed seven-segment displays (common anode) controlled by a **7447 BCD to seven-segment decoder**.  
- **Push Buttons:** 10 buttons for start, stop, reset, mode toggle, and time adjustment.  
- **Alarm/Buzzer:** Provides audio feedback when the countdown reaches zero.  
- **LED Indicators:** Indicate the active mode (increment or countdown).
